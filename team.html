          I joined our team because I love dogs and it was a new and exciting opportunity. There is always something new to learn with the dogs. They have taught me a lot about myself.
          <br><br>
          Fun fact: I have 2 inches of cadaver bone in my right leg.
          <br><br>
          My favorite part about working for Personal Paws is that we are the voices for the dogs and we help better the communications/relationships between our clients and their dogs.

          I joined the Personal Paws team because I’ve always loved dogs and have always wanted to learn how to train my dog properly, so she could become the best version of herself.
          <br><br>
          Fun Fact: I attend SUNY, and SCCC, for craft Beer Brewing Company and intern at BYE- I Brewing Company.
          <br><br>
          My favorite part about working for this company is not just meeting and working with so many awesome dogs but being on a team with some amazing individuals.

          I joined Personal Paws because I believed in their mission and goals within the community and with the dogs.
          <br><br>
          Fun Fact: I was a Union electrician before starting to work with dogs.
          <br><br>
          My favorite part about working at Personal Paws is the excitement and growth you get to see out of the dogs everyday.
