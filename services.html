        This service is designed to maintain your dogs basic obedience/ foundational skills. These foundational skills need to be kept up with on a daily if not weekly basis, to ensure that your pup is a well rounded, calm, confident individual. Our Structured walk works on not only leash skills and obedience but works on proper socialization. This service teaches our pack to not only introduce themselves appropriately while on leash but to also work around and with other dogs. ( not every time they see a dog is it “recess” ) We teach the pack to work hard together in low and high distraction areas to proof their foundational skills. This is to ensure your pup is not only getting the mental stimulation they need during their days but also to ensure that your dog is a confident well rounded individual, that can handle ANY real life scenario.

This service is designed for the pups who need a bit more training wise to get extra energy out. This service is great for working breeds. This allows for them to get some energy out then quickly getting into obedience and then back to running it out again! This program not only works on mental stimulation and physical stimulation but this program helps with building confidence.
