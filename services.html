        <h2>Homeschool Students</h2>
        <p>This service was started during the pandemic as a great option for families interesting in training services, to get the best of both worlds! This service includes 4 - 6 hours of structured training & socialization. We customize this service to meet the needs of each individual dog. This includes but is not limited to puppy conditioning,  house manners, basic & intermediate obedience, and proper socialization both on and off leash.</p>
        <p>This service includes the same amenities as the Full-Time Students but with an added bonus: Homework! This includes homework that you will recieve each week, sent to your email to complete, practice & proof at home with your pup. The homework will include additional videos to help you see exactly what we are working on so you can understand it completely.</p>
        <p><i>This sevice requires a 2 day a week minimum</i></p>
        <p>Once your pup is tuned up we will schedule a Parent/Teacher conference call to discuss any questions or concerns and make sure the education is being transferred over properly. We go at the dog's speed, because just like us they are all different</p>

        <p>Our Treadmill Circuit Training service is designed for the pups who need a bit more to get the extra energy out! We highly recommend this service for working breeds. With this service we create a custom circuit that goes from treadmill running, to obedience training, then back to running it out again! This program not only works on mental and physical stimulation but also helps with basic confidence! </p>
